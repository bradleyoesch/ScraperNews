Scraper News
============

Scrapes Hacker News and tweets (@ScraperNews) all posts with at least 50 comments.

To run, install scrapy and twython. You must have your own twitter handle and app (apps.twitter.com) with your phone number attached in order to have read/write access.

Currently runs every 15 minutes with a kind of sketchy command line loop, but I don't know what the correct way is to run certain commands in the command line at a time interval.
